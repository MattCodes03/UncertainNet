# 🧠 UncertainNet

**UncertainNet** is an experimental, open-source C++ neural network framework built from the ground up with **inherent uncertainty quantification** at every stage of computation.

Whether you're researching Bayesian deep learning, building robust AI systems, or just want a fast, modern neural net library in C++, **UncertainNet** gives you direct access to the uncertainty inside your models — not just their predictions.

## 🌟 Key Features

- ✅ **Built-in Uncertainty Quantification**
  - Support for **epistemic** (model) and **aleatoric** (data) uncertainty
  - Techniques like **MC Dropout**, **Bayesian layers**, **distributional outputs**
  
- 🧱 **Modular Architecture**
  - Clean layer interface (e.g., `Dense`, `Conv2D`, `Dropout`, `BayesianDense`)
  - Custom loss functions (e.g., NLL, heteroscedastic MSE)
  - Lightweight `Tensor` operations built from scratch

- 🧪 **Probabilistic Output Layers**
  - Predict full probability distributions, not just point estimates

- ⚙️ **Pure C++ Implementation**
  - No heavy external dependencies
  - Easily portable and embeddable
